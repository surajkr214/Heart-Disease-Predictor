# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

A machine learning application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient clinical data.

## 📊 Overview
This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It features an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard that allows users to input medical metrics via sliders and receive real-time risk assessments.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly sliders for data input.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instant classification (Healthy vs. Potential Heart Disease).
- **Probability Score**: Displays the model's confidence percentage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (Frontend)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
